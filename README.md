# The Nightmare Before Christmas - CSS Movie Poster

This was a project developed during my first semester of a HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals course. 

A CSS-rendered movie poster rendition of the well-known Tim Burton film "The Nightmare Before Christmas." The project was a great challenge to understanding CSS positioning and how parent HTML elements relate to their children. Note the project was designed specifically for larger desktop screen widths and was not built with responsiveness in mind.
